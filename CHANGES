0.7.0   20070803 - Added an optional parameter to the find_lines(), 
        find_children(), find_all_children(), and find_blocks() methods.  This
	parameter will allow the user to specify whether he wants an "exact"
	match or a normal regex match.  Also fixed a bug that broke parsing
	of configs with an indented line at the very end.

0.6.8   20070802 - Ported fixes to the CiscoPassword class from the 
        cisco_decrypt package.  Notably, there were crashes when it was called
	with certain unencrypted passwords.

0.6.7   20070801 - Fixed bug where some methods didn't return False when no 
        diffs were found

0.6.6   20070730 - Added password decryption options to the command-line help
        menu.  Modified all diff functions to return False if no diffs are found

0.6.5   20070728 - Fixed another CiscoPassword bug. Added warning if 
        CiscoPassword decryption fails.  Added command-line functionality for 
	improved interoperability with other languages (and shell-usage if 
	you like).

0.6.1   20070726 - Cosmetic restructuring of code

0.6.0   20070721 - Revised APIs.  Existing APIs should be stable now
